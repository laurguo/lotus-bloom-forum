# Lotus Bloom Forum

> A full-stack web discussion forum to support communication and resource sharing for Oakland-based nonprofit family resource centers.

## 🌟 Overview

This forum was developed as part of a Codebase project in partnership with [Lotus Bloom](https://www.lotusbloomfamily.org/), a nonprofit that supports families across Oakland. The platform helps Lotus Bloom staff and community members share updates, resources, and announcements across multiple physical sites.

**Note:** The deployed site is private and accessible only to users at Lotus Bloom.

## 🧩 Features

- Post creation, editing, and deletion
- Role-based access control for staff/admins
- Like and comment functionality

- Responsive frontend UI with modern design

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js
- **Backend**: Neon (PostgreSQL), Vercel Blob
- **Authentication**: Auth0
- **Design**: Figma
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## 👩‍💻 My Contributions

I worked as a full-stack developer on the project, focusing on both the user interface and core backend logic for post interactions.

### ✨ Frontend
- Built the **specific site page** that displays the list of posts
- Developed the **post creation page**, integrating form validation and submission flow
- Implemented dynamic updates to post lists based on user interaction (e.g. likes, edits)

### 🧠 Backend
- Designed and implemented backend logic for:
  - **Creating**, **editing**, and **deleting** posts
  - **Liking** posts (with toggle functionality)
- Collaborated with team members to integrate database schema with frontend requirements

## 🔐 Deployment

The app is deployed and actively used by Lotus Bloom staff. While the site is publicly accessible, it requires login via email-based authentication. Please note that the platform is intended solely for internal use, and external access is discouraged out of respect for organizational privacy.
